// ðŸ”¹ 2. Inheritance (Tricky Question with All Types)
// ðŸ‘‰ Scenario: You are working on a vehicle rental system. Different types of vehicles share some common properties, but there are multiple levels and categories of vehicles.

// âœ… Task:

// Create a Vehicle class with properties brand and year.
// Create a Car class that extends Vehicle and adds a fuelType property.
// Create a Bike class that extends Vehicle and adds a hasGear property.
// Add another class ElectricCar that extends Car and adds a batteryCapacity property.
// Implement a getDetails() method in Vehicle and override it in different subclasses.
